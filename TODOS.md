## Todos

- **Manage unified single virtual env**
  - [x] Install repo deps in a unified dev venv
    - [x] Installing in less pip calls possible? Maybe just use a tempory `requirements.txt`?
  - [x] "Dependency Merger" (creates list of conflict-free dependencies from all repos)
      - [x] Implement merger
      - [x] Check if repo deps are conflict-free
      - [x] Consider all (optional) groups
        - [x] And remove them from qpy-dev `pyproject.toml`
      - [x] Use `dict[dep.name, tuple[Dep, Pkg]]` for `DependencyMerger._deps`?
      - [x] Use (version constraint) intersection of conflicting deps
        - Raise error if result is empty
      - [x] Consider dep extras: use union of conflicting deps extras
      - (Idea: Choose one or the other interactively when a conflict occurs. Can also be done manually/is probably overkill.)
- **Common developer tasks and workflows**
  - post-checkout hook that set ups venv automatically?
  - [x] Manage Moodle dev stack
    - [x] Tasks
      - [x] start
      - [x] stop

      - [x] access to docker-compose command
    - [x] Automate config (`local.yml`)
      - [x] Add `host.docker.internal` to webserver container `/etc/hosts` so QPy server can be specified by using a fixed hostname in Moodle
      - [x] `qtype-questionpy` as bind volume into the webserver container
    - [x] Start/stop hooks (mainly need this for creating/removing a Firewall rule to allow the Moodle webserver container to access the QPy server on my host)
  - [x] QPy server
    - [x] Tasks

  - Docs
    - [x] Build docs using mkdocs
    - [x] Watch docs
    - [ ] Publish docs
- **Update tooling**
  - [x] Add ruff (replacing Pylint, Flake8)
    - Possible to have preset rules (like Eslint sharable config)?  
      - No, not yet. https://github.com/astral-sh/ruff/discussions/3363
        - [x] Can be mimicked by using [`extend`](https://docs.astral.sh/ruff/settings/#extend)  
          Solution: Have `ruff_defaults.toml` in `qpy-dev` and create command that sync's it into the QPy repos.  
          Look at [hatch default config](https://hatch.pypa.io/latest/config/static-analysis/#default-settings)  
          https://github.com/pypa/hatch/blob/master/ruff_defaults.toml
    - extra rules?  
      ```toml
      # allow star imports, permit line breaks before (but not after) binary operators
      ignore = F403 F405 W503
      ```
